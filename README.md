A mobile client application for Lloud music streaming service.

Note: We shut down Lloud and removed it from the app store.

[Here's a short video of what it was.](https://youtu.be/7GgLJumw0Dc)

## Idea

Lloud was a music streaming service designed to incentivize listeners to find and promote new artists.

### How it worked

- Fans scroll the main song feed in the app
- When they find a song they enjoy, they "like" the song which is essentially placing a bet on that song
- If additional people like that same song, the fan receives points
- The fan can redeem points for rewards such as exclusive merchandise
- When the fan runs out of likes (aka bets) they can purchase more

## App
